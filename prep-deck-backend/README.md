<h2>About the Project</h2> 
Prep Deck helps you to test your knowledge of software engineering topics and prepare you for coding interviews during your job search.  
Simply cylce through the questions.  Add questions to your deck that you need to come back to for more practice, or to remind you of gaps in your knowledge that you need to research and fill in.  Remove questions from your deck once you feel you have mastered that topic. 

This is a Single Page Application project using Ruby on Rails backend API and a frontend built with Javascript, HTML and CSS.
